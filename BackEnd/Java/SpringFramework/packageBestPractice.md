# Packages

The prefix of a unique package name is always written in all-lowercase ASCII letters and should be one of the top-level
domain names, currently com, edu, gov, mil, net, org, or one of the English two-letter codes identifying countries as
specified in ISO Standard 3166, 1981.
Subsequent components of the package name vary according to an organization's own internal naming conventions. Such
conventions might specify that certain directory name components be division, department, project, machine, or login
names.
