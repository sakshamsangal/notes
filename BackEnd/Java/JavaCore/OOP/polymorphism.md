    Polymorphism:

```
    Polymorphism is that in which we can perform a task in multiple forms or ways. It is applied to the functions or methods. Polymorphism allows the object to decide which form of the function to implement at compile-time as well as run-time.

    Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.

In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass. The determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.

eg

Below are some of the rules of runtime polymorphism:

Methods of child and parent class must have the same name.
Methods of child and parent class must have the same parameter.
IS-A relationship is mandatory (inheritance).
Below are some of the limitations of runtime polymorphism

One cannot override private methods of a parent class.
One cannot override Final methods.
One cannot override static methods.
