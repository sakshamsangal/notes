A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or
methods that are common to all objects of one type. In general, class declarations can include these components, in
order:

Modifiers: A class can be public or has default access.
Class name:The name should begin with an initial letter (capitalized by convention).
Superclass(if any): The name of the classâ€™s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can
only extend (subclass) one parent.
Interfaces(if any): A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword
implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
Body: The class body surrounded by braces, { }.

implemented implements surrounded
